       <li>Cover beans with water by 2 inches; stir in 1 tablespoon garlic, tomato, cumin, and chili powder. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until beans are very soft, about 3 hours and 45 minutes, adding water as needed.</li>
       <li>Once beans have cooked, mash them with remaining garlic, oil, and salt; add water as needed to achieve desired consistency. Place over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
